# SureHA 🐾

> **Note:** This is a modified, enhanced, and actively maintained fork of the original SureHA integration. 

## ✨ New Features in this Fork
* **Smart Duration Tracking:** The pet location sensor now includes a `for` attribute (e.g., `1d 04:30` or `02:15`), calculating exactly how long your pet has been inside or outside. No more need for complex Jinja2 templates!
* **Enhanced Battery & Connectivity Stats:** Added exact voltage per cell and formatted RSSI signal strengths for easier debugging of hub connections.

### `sureha.set_pet_location`
 
 This service call allows you to update the location of a pet manually. <br>
 Data needed:<br>
   - `pet_id` = this is the surepetcare id for your pet. <br>
   - `where` = options are "Inside" or "Outside"

Example:
```yaml
service: sureha.set_pet_location
data:
  pet_id: 31337
  where: Inside
```

### `sureha.set_lock_state`

 This service call allows you to update the lock state of a flap.
  
 Data needed:<br>
   - `flap_id` = this is the surepetcare id for the flap you want to change.<br>
   - `lock_state` = locked, unlocked, in_only, out_only

service: sureha.set_lock_state
data:
  flap_id: 123456
  lock_state: locked
```


## Useful stuff

The following script and button card code was created by xbmcnut to set pets location to inside:
```yaml
script:
  set_kobe_inside:
    alias: 'Set Kobe Inside'
    sequence:
      - service: sureha.set_pet_location
        data:
          pet_id: '123456' #Kobe's Code
          where: Inside      
```

Button card code:
```yaml
type: custom:button-card
entity: binary_sensor.pet_kobe
icon: mdi:cat
layout: icon_name_state
show_name: false
show_state: true
styles:
  icon:
    - color: >
        [[[ if (states['binary_sensor.pet_kobe'].state === 'on') return "green";
        return "red"; ]]]
tap_action:
  action: more-info
hold_action:
  action: call-service
  service: script.set_kobe_inside
```

The following script was created by sasgoose to toggle the location of a pet:

```yaml
script:
  toggle_thorin_location:
      alias: 'Toggle Thorin location'
      sequence:
        choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: binary_sensor.pet_thorin_2
              attribute: where
              state: 1
          sequence:
            - service: sureha.set_pet_location
              data:
                pet_id: '123456' # Thorin's pet id
                where: Outside
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: binary_sensor.pet_thorin_2
              attribute: where
              state: 2
          sequence:
            - service: sureha.set_pet_location
              data:
                pet_id: '123456' # Thorin's pet id
                where: Inside
                
```

## Debugging

Enable the debug logging in `configuration.yaml` if something does not work as expected:

```yaml
# logging
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    surepy: debug
    custom_components.sureha: debug
    custom_components.sureha.binary_sensor: debug
    custom_components.sureha.sensor: debug
```
